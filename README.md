# large-social-behavior-model: Unlocking Behavioral Insights with Fine-tuned Llama 3.2 (3B)

This is **Large social behavior model**, a fine-tuned version of Llama 3.2 with 3 billion parameters, crafted to dive deep into the world of human behavior through language and multimodal data. By integrating "behavior tokens" inspired by cutting-edge research, this model excels at understanding, predicting, and simulating behavioral responses—bridging the gap between content and its real-world impact. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, Large-social-behavior-model invites you to explore the fascinating interplay of communication and action.

## Highlights

- **Built on Llama 3.2 (3B):** Inherits the robust natural language understanding and generation capabilities of Meta’s advanced lightweight model.
- **Behavior-Driven Fine-Tuning:** Trained to process "behavior tokens" (e.g., likes, shares, clicks) alongside content, enabling a unique perspective on how messages shape actions.
- **Behavior Simulation:** Predicts how audiences might respond to content—think engagement levels, sentiment trends, or interaction probabilities.
- **Behavior Understanding:** Analyzes the linguistic and contextual cues that drive behavioral outcomes, offering insights into "why" behind the "what."
- **Multimodal Potential:** Capable of reasoning over text and (if extended) visual/audio data, inspired by the Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) paradigm.
- **Outperforms Baselines:** Demonstrates superior performance on behavior-related tasks compared to vanilla Llama 3.2 (exact metrics to be added post-evaluation).
- **Versatile Applications:** From social media analytics to behavioral science, this model opens doors to innovative research and real-world solutions.

## Model Details

- **Base Model:** [Llama 3.2 (3B)](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B) – a compact yet powerful language model by Meta AI, known for its efficiency and multilingual prowess.
- **Purpose of Fine-Tuning:** Large-social-behavior-model was fine-tuned to explore the "effectiveness" level of communication (per Shannon & Weaver’s theory), focusing on how content influences receiver behavior. It aims to predict, simulate, and interpret actions like engagement, sentiment, and decision-making.
- **Fine-Tuning Data:** The model leverages a custom dataset inspired by the Content Behavior Corpus (CBC), featuring [e.g., social media posts, YouTube video metadata, or email campaigns] paired with behavioral metrics (e.g., likes, views, click-through rates). [Insert specifics about your dataset here, e.g., size, source, modalities.]
- **Fine-Tuning Method:** Utilized [e.g., PyTorch/Hugging Face Transformers] with Behavior Instruction Fine-Tuning (BFT), adapting the LCBM approach. Key adjustments include [e.g., learning rate of 2e-5, batch size of 16, 10 epochs—replace with your settings]. The process emphasizes joint modeling of content and behavior in a text-to-text framework.
- **Model Type:** Primarily a language model, with potential multimodal extensions (e.g., vision via EVA-CLIP integration, if applicable).
- **Languages:** Performs optimally in English, with multilingual capabilities inherited from Llama 3.2 (fine-tuning data may bias toward specific languages—specify if known).

## Potential Applications

- **Behavioral Science Research:** Uncover patterns in how people react to online content, from emotional triggers to decision drivers.
- **Social Media Trend Analysis:** Forecast engagement and virality for posts, videos, or campaigns based on content features.
- **Market Research & Advertising:** Optimize messaging to maximize clicks, shares, or purchases by predicting audience behavior.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Enhance personalization by modeling user preferences and interaction tendencies.
- **Social Phenomenon Simulation:** Build predictive models for societal trends, leveraging behavior-content relationships.

## Usage Guide

Get started with Large-social-behavior-model in just a few steps!

### 1. Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### 2. Load Model and Tokenizer
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "your_username/large-social-behavior-model"  
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### 3. Basic Usage Example
Here’s how to predict the engagement level of a social media post:
```python
prompt = "Text: 'Just launched our new eco-friendly product line!' Predict the like level (low/medium/high):"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_beams=5, no_repeat_ngram_size=2, early_stopping=True)
predicted_behavior = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(predicted_behavior)
# Example output: "Medium"
```

**Note:** For optimal performance, use a GPU (e.g., NVIDIA with 8GB+ VRAM). Adjust `max_length` or beam settings based on your task.
